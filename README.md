# Wine-Quality-Project

Wine quality prediction is an interesting machine learning problem that fits both regression and classification, allowing the comparison of the two approaches. We used multivariate linear regression as our regression method and softmax regression as our classification method, on two datasets containing the chemical properties of a number of vinho verde samples, one for red wines and one for white wines, regression yelded better performance in our testing.
