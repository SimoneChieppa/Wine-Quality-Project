# Wine-Quality-Project


Predicting wine quality is an interesting machine learning problem that can be approached through both regression and classification techniques, enabling a comparison between the two approaches. In this project, we employed multivariate linear regression as our regression method and softmax regression as our classification method. We conducted our analysis on two datasets, one for red wines and another for white wines, containing chemical properties of several vinho verde samples.
